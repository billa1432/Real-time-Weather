# Weather_App
This Python project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to provide current weather information for a specified city. It prompts the user to enter a city name, fetches weather data from the API, and display the information like temperature,rainfall, and visibility etc regarding current weather of specific city.


## Setup, Installation and Run
Install Python: If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to add Python to your system's PATH during installation.

Install the Requests Library: If you haven't already, you'll need to install the `requests` library. You can do this using `pip`, the Python package manager, by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
pip install requests
Replace the API Key: Replace '30d4741c779ba94c470ca1f63045390a' with your own valid OpenWeatherMap API key in the code.

Run the Script: Save the code to a .py file (e.g., weather.py) and run it using the Python interpreter:
python weather.py
Enter a City: After running the script, it will prompt you to enter a city. Type the name of the city you want to get weather information for and press Enter.

The script will then make an API request to OpenWeatherMap, retrieve the weather data, and display it on the terminal.
